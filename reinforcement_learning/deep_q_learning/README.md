# Breakout Reinforcement Learning Agent

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent designed to play the classic arcade game *Breakout*. Using OpenAI's Gym environment and Deep Q-Learning (DQN) techniques, the agent learns to control a paddle to break bricks by bouncing a ball against them.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a reinforcement learning (RL) agent can be trained to master a game through trial and error. The agent uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to approximate the Q-function and learns to select optimal actions for maximizing cumulative rewards.

```
3. Install required dependencies

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### File Descriptions

- **`train.py`**:  
  - The main script for training the RL agent.  
  - Includes environment setup, model initialization, and the training loop.  
  - Saves the trained model to the `models/` directory.

- **`play.py`**:  
  - A script to load a trained model and test the agent's performance in the Breakout game.  
  - Visualizes the gameplay.

- **`models/`**:  
  - A directory to save the trained models.  
  - Example: `dqn_model.pth`.

- **`requirements.txt`**:  
  - Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Usage

### Training the Agent

To train the RL agent, run the train.py script:
``` bash
python train.py
```

The script will:
- Initialize the environment.
- Train the agent using the DQN algorithm.
- Save the trained model to the `models/` directory.

### Playing the Game

To test the trained agent, run the play.py script:

```
python play.py
```
This script will:
- Load the trained model from the models/ directory.
- Simulate a game of Breakout with the agent’s actions.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Gym (for the Breakout environment)
- PyTorch (for the neural network)
- NumPy (for mathematical operations)
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing training progress)

Install all dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
