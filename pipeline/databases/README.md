# Project: Data Storage for Machine Learning

After fetching data via APIs, storing them is also really important for training a Machine Learning model.

You have multiple options:

- Relational database
- Non-relational database
- Key-Value storage
- Document storage
- Data Lake
- etc.

In this project, you will touch the first two: relational and non-relational databases.

## Relational Databases

Relational databases are mainly used for applications, not as a source of data for training your ML models, but they can be really useful for data processing, labeling, and injecting data into another data storage. In this project, you will play with basic SQL commands, create automation, and compute data directly in SQL—resulting in less load at your application level since the computing power is dispatched to the database.

## Non-Relational Databases

Non-relational databases, known as NoSQL, will give you flexibility with your data: document storage, versioning, no fixed schema, no validation to improve performance, complex lookups, etc.

## Requirements

### General:
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your SQL files will be executed on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (or 18.04) using MySQL 5.7 (version 5.7.30)
- All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e., syntax above)
- All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (SELECT, WHERE…)
- All your Mongo files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (or 18.04) using MongoDB (version 4.2)
- The first line of all your Mongo files should be a comment: `// my comment`
- All your Python files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (or 18.04) using python3 (version 3.5 or 3.7) and PyMongo (version 3.10)
- The first line of all Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Your Python code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)
- All your Python modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your Python functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Your Python code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
