## Learning Objectives

This project will cover the following key topics:

- **Markov Chains**: 
  - Markov property
  - Definition of Markov chain, state, and transition probability/matrix
  - Stationary state, regular Markov chain, and determining matrix regularity
  - Absorbing, transient, and recurrent states
  - Absorbing Markov chains

- **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**:
  - Hidden state, observation, and emission probability/matrix
  - Trellis diagrams
  - Implementing the Forward, Viterbi, and Forward-Backward algorithms
  - Understanding decoding and the Baum-Welch algorithm

## Requirements

### General
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Python 3.5
- **Libraries**: numpy (version 1.15) only; import as `import numpy as np`
- **Style Guide**: Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.4)
- **File Specifications**:
  - All files must end with a new line
  - The first line should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - All files must be executable
  - Documentation is required for all modules, classes, and functions

### Documentation
- Use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'` to view module documentation.
- Use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'` for class documentation.
- Use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` for function documentation (inside or outside classes).

## Project Structure
All files for this project should be located in the root directory and structured as per the guidelines. A README.md file is required as part of the project submission.

Happy learning and coding!
