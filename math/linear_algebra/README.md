# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

- What is a vector?
- What is a matrix?
- What is a transpose?
- What is the shape of a matrix?
- What is an axis?
- What is a slice?
- How do you slice a vector/matrix?
- What are element-wise operations?
- How do you concatenate vectors/matrices?
- What is the dot product?
- What is matrix multiplication?
- What is Numpy?
- What is parallelization and why is it important?
- What is broadcasting?

# Requirements

## Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
- Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.5)
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
