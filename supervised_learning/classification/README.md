## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment:** All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5) and executed with numpy (version 1.15)
- **Coding style:** All your files should end with a new line. The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`. Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4).
- **Documentation:** 
  - All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
  - All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
  - All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- **Imports:** Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except `import numpy as np`.
- **Loops:** Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to use any loops (for, while, etc.).
- **Executable files:** All your files must be executable.
- **File length:** The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
