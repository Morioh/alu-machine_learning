## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

### General
- What is the confusion matrix?
- What is type I error? type II?
- What is sensitivity? specificity? precision? recall?
- What is an F1 score?
- What is bias? variance?
- What is irreducible error?
- What is Bayes error?
- How can you approximate Bayes error?
- How to calculate bias and variance
- How to create a confusion matrix

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
- Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4)
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)`)
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except `import numpy as np`
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
