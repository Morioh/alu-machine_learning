# Neural Style Transfer: Creating Art with Deep Learning

This project explores Neural Style Transfer (NST) using TensorFlow's `tf.keras` and Eager Execution. It focuses on applying deep convolutional networks (CNNs) to create artistic images by merging the content of one image with the style of another.

## Requirements

### General :
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using Python 3.5
- Use `numpy` version 1.15 and `tensorflow` version 1.12
- Files must end with a new line
- First line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` style (version 2.4)
- Modules, classes, and functions should have proper documentation
- Only `numpy` and `tensorflow` imports are allowed unless stated otherwise
- All files must be executable

## Data:
